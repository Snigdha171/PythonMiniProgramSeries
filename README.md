# PythonMiniProgramSeries

*Python is a simple programming language and it helps to automate most of our daily tasks. You must have gone through many tutorials to understand each topic. However, programming becomes comfortable only through practice. In this series, we will try to create simple programs using 2 or 3 concepts to help you get familiar and comfortable with Python Automation. If this sounds interesting, feel free to join us in this "[Python Mini Program Series](https://pythonminiprogramseries.blogspot.com/)" journey. Happy Coding!!*

## Here goes the program details - 

### [1. Python program to search data using Google Search](https://github.com/Snigdha171/PythonMiniProgramSeries/tree/master/AutomateGoogleSearch) - 

```Here, we take word to be searched as an input from the user and sends http request to google search page. We read the response from the 'knowledge panel' and displays it as a result to the user. For cases where no result is returned from the knowledge pane, this programs displays the link of the topmost search.```

### [2. Python program to find the frequency of words used in paragraph](https://github.com/Snigdha171/PythonMiniProgramSeries/tree/master/FindWordFrequency) - 

```Here, we take input from the user in form of paragrapgh.txt file that contains the content to be read. We do the basic data cleaning such as removing the punctuation, converting to standard case and removing the stop words. The program generates the 3 most commonly used words by finding the frequency of each word.```

### [3. Python program to search given words in a text file](https://github.com/Snigdha171/PythonMiniProgramSeries/tree/master/PatternMatching) - 

```Here, we takes two inputs from the user - 1) The word to be searched and 2) A text file in form of sample_input.txt file that contains the content to be read. The program generates an ouput file named sample_output.txt with the searched word highlighted.```

### [4. Python program to detect objects in an given input Image](https://github.com/Snigdha171/PythonMiniProgramSeries/tree/master/ImageDetection) - 

```This program deals with Image detection and Extraction It will detect various objects of interest and store them in separate image files.```

### [5. Python program to connect to light-weight database](https://github.com/Snigdha171/PythonMiniProgramSeries/tree/master/SQLLiteDBConnection) - 

```This program help to connect to sql database, create tables and perform data manipulations using Python```
